Let us look more carefully at this problem: how can some value be changed, let us look at several examples:
`3 -> 6, 5 -> 10, 7 -> 14`, that is for odd number we can have only two candidates.
`2 -> 1, 4 -> 2 -> 1, 6 -> 3, 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, 10 -> 5, 12 -> 6 -> 3` and so on

Now, we can reformulate our problem in the following way: we are given several lists and we need to choose candidate from each of these lists, such that deviation is minimized. This is exactly what problem **632 Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists** is about and we can reuse the idea.

So, we have lists `L1, l2, ..., Ln` and let us put all smallest values from each list to heap. On each step we extract the smallest element `num` from heap and put `2*num` to this heap if it is possible and update range. How we can understand if we need to put new element to heap? We need to keep pairs `(num, limit)` in our heap, for example:

`3` -> candidates `(3,6)`, what we put it heap on the first step is `(3, 6)`.
`12` -> candidates `(3, 6, 12)`, what we put in heap on the first step is `(3, 12)`.

Also we need to keep maximum value of elements in heap `Max` and update it when needed.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(m log n)`, where `n` is length of `nums` and `m` is total number of candidates, we can estimate it as `m = O(n log K)`, where `K` is the biggest number. Finally, it will be `O(n log n  log K)`. Space complexity is `O(n)` to keep our heap.

```
class Solution:
    def minimumDeviation(self, nums):
        heap = []
        for num in nums:
            tmp = num
            while tmp%2 == 0: tmp//=2
            heap.append((tmp, max(num, tmp*2)))
        
        Max = max(i for i,j in heap)
        heapify(heap)
        ans = float("inf")

        while len(heap) == len(nums):
            num, limit = heappop(heap)
            ans = min(ans, Max - num)
            if num < limit:
                heappush(heap, (num*2, limit))
                Max = max(Max, num*2)
            
        return ans
