title: Leetcode 0021. Merge Two Sorted Lists
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0021/
---

What we need to do in this problem is implement merge of two sorted list, such that final list is also sorted: this is classical step for example for well-known **merge sort**. To make our code more clean, we use dummy variable. Then we have main steps in our algorithm:
1. Compare values in `l1` and `l2` nodes of our lists: if first one is smaller, attach it to the end of new list and move it, if second one is smaller, do the same with it.
2. We use condition `while l1 and l2`, that is if one of the lists finished, we still have some ending of another list, which we need to attach to the end.
3. Finally, just return node next to dummy variable in our list.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n+m)`, where `n` and `m` are lengths of our lists: we traverse them only once. Space complexity is `O(1)`, because we do not create new objects and just reconnect already existing ones.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
        head = tail = ListNode(-1)
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val > l2.val:
                tail.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            else:
                tail.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            tail = tail.next
        
        if l1: tail.next = l1
        if l2: tail.next = l2
        
        return head.next
```
