title: Leetcode 0096. Unique Binary Search Trees
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0096/

In this problem we are asked to get number of trees and not necceseraly to return all trees, only **number**. Here we can use the idea of **dynamic programming**, let `dp[n]` be the number of unique Binary Search Trees with `n` nodes. How can we evaluate them: we need to choose number of nodes in the left subtree and number of nodes in the right subtree, for example `n=5`, then we have options:
1. left subtree has 0 nodes, root = 1, and right subtree has 4 nodes, number of options `f[0]*f[4]`
2. left subtree has 1 nodes, root = 2, and right subtree has 3 nodes, number of options `f[1]*f[3]`
3. left subtree has 2 nodes, root = 3, and right subtree has 2 nodes, number of options `f[2]*f[2]`
4. left subtree has 3 nodes, root = 4, and right subtree has 1 nodes, number of options `f[3]*f[1]`
5. left subtree has 4 nodes, root = 5, and right subtree has 0 nodes, number of options `f[4]*f[0]`

So, in total `f[5] = f[0]*f[4] + f[1]*f[3] + f[2]*f[2] + f[3]*f[1] + f[4]*f[0]`, and in general:
`f[n] = f[0]*f[n-1] + f[1]*f[n-2] + ... + f[n-2]*f[1] + f[n-1]*f[0]`.

We can solve this in classical **dynamic programming** way with `O(n^2)` complexity. However we can recognize in this formula **Catalan Numbers**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number and there is direct formula to evaluate them:
`f[n] = (2n)!/(n! * n! * (n+1))`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` to evaluate all factorials, space complexity is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n):
        return factorial(2*n)//factorial(n)//factorial(n)//(n+1)
```
