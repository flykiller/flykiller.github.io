title: Leetcode 0103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0103/
---

In this problem we need to traverse binary tree level by level. When we see levels in binary tree, we need to think about **bfs**, because it is its logic: it first traverse all neighbors, before we go deeper. Here we also need to change direction on each level as well. So, algorithm is the following:

1. We create **queue**, where we first put our root.
2. `result` is to keep final result and `direction`, equal to `1` or `-1` is direction of traverse.
3. Then we start to traverse level by level: if we have `k` elements in queue currently, we remove them all and put their children instead. We continue to do this until our queue is empty. Meanwile we form `level` list and then add it to `result`, using correct direction and change direction after.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is number of nodes in our binary tree. Space complexity is also `O(n)`, because our `result` has this size in the end. If we do not count output as additional space, then it will be `O(w)`, where `w` is width of tree. It can be reduces to `O(1)` I think if we traverse levels in different order directly, but it is just not worth it.

```
class Solution:
    def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root):
        if not root: return []
        queue = deque([root])
        result, direction = [], 1
        
        while queue:
            level = []
            for i in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                level.append(node.val)
                if node.left:  queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right: queue.append(node.right)
            result.append(level[::direction])
            direction *= (-1)
        return result
```
