title: Leetcode 0191. Number of 1 Bits

There are a lot of different ways to solve this problem, starting from transforming number to string and count number of ones. However there is a classical bit manipulation trick you should think about when you have bits problem.

If we have number `n`, then `n&(n-1)` **will remove the rightmost** in binary representation of `n`. For example if `n = 10110100`, then `n & (n-1) = 10110100 & 10110011 = 10110000`, where `&` means bitwize operation and. Very convinient, is it not? What we need to do now, just repeat this operation until we have `n = 0` and count number of steps.

**Complexity** It is `O(1)` for sure, because we need to make no more than `32` operations here, but it is quite vague: all methods will be `O(1)`, why this one is better than others? In fact it has complexity `O(m)`, where `m` is number of `1`-bits in our number. In average it will be `16` bits, so it is more like `16` operations, not `32` here, which gives us 2-times gain. Space complexity is `O(1)`

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        ans = 0
        while n:
            n &= (n-1)
            ans += 1
        return ans
```

## just 5 operations
You can stop on previous solution and interviewer will be OK with that. But if you show him the following solution, he will be really happy. Let us understand what is going on in the following code.

1. First of all `0x55555555 = 01010101010101010101010101010101` in binary representation, so first step will deal with even and odd bits. What happens after first line of code computed: it will count number of non-zero bits in each pair. For simplicity imagine just first `8` bits with constant `0x55 = 01010101` and choose `n = 11000110`, then we have is `10 00 01 01`. Why? We have `2`, that is `10` ones in first pair, than we have `0` ones, than we have `1` one and finally we also have `1`.
2. Now, to the second step, we have `0x33333333 = 110011001100110011001100110011`. Again let us look at only first `8` bit, that is to `11001100`. What will happend after this step, number of non-zero bits in groups of `4` will be computed. We stopped on number `10 00 01 01`, now we have `0010 0010`, because there is `2 + 0` ones in first group and `1+1` ones in second group.
3. Next step is `0x0f0f0f0f = 1111000011110000111100001111` and we working with groups of `8`, so for our example we will have `00000100`, because we have `2` ones in each group.

**Complexity**: we have only `5` iterations for `int32` number, it will be `6` for `int64`, `7` for `int128` and so on. For `int32` there will be not increase of speed, because even though it is `5` operations, each of them consists of several small steps, but for `int64` you can fill the difference. Space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        n = (n & (0x55555555)) + ((n >> 1) & (0x55555555))
        n = (n & (0x33333333)) + ((n >> 2) & (0x33333333))
        n = (n & (0x0f0f0f0f)) + ((n >> 4) & (0x0f0f0f0f))
        n = (n & (0x00ff00ff)) + ((n >> 8) & (0x00ff00ff))
        n = (n & (0x0000ffff)) + ((n >> 16) & (0x0000ffff))
        return n
