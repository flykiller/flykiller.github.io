title: Leetcode 0497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0497/
---

Basically, this problem is extention of problem **528. Random Pick with Weight**, let me explain why. Here we have several rectangles and we need to choose point from these rectangles. We can do in in two steps:

1. Choose rectangle. Note, that the bigger number of points in these rectangle the more should be our changes. Imagine, we have two rectangles with 10 and 6 points. Then we need to choose first rectangle with probability `10/16` and second with probability `6/16`.
2. Choose point inside this rectangle. We need to choose coordinate `x` and coordinate `y` uniformly.

When we `initailze` we count weights as `(x2-x1+1)*(y2-y1+1)` because we also need to use boundary. Then we evaluate cumulative sums and normalize.

For `pick` function, we use **binary search** to find the right place, using uniform distribution from `[0,1]` and then we use uniform discrete distribution to choose coordinates `x` and `y`. 

**Complexity**: Time and space complexity of `__init__` is `O(n)`, where `n` is number of rectangles. Time complexity of `pick` is `O(log n)`, because we use binary search. Space complexity of `pick` is `O(1)`.

**Remark**: Note, that there is solution with `O(1)` time/space complexity for `pick`, using smart mathematical trick, see my solution of problem **528**: https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/discuss/671439/Python-Smart-O(1)-solution-with-detailed-explanation


```
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, rects):
        w = [(x2-x1+1)*(y2-y1+1) for x1,y1,x2,y2 in rects]
        self.weights = [i/sum(w) for i in accumulate(w)]
        self.rects = rects

    def pick(self):
        n_rect = bisect.bisect(self.weights, random.random())
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.rects[n_rect] 
        return [random.randint(x1, x2),random.randint(y1, y2)]
