### 1. Dynamic programming solution
One way to solve this problem is to use **dynamic programming**: define by `dp[i][j]` number of ways to reach point `(i,j)`. How can we reach it, there are two options:
1. We can reach it from above `(i, j-1)`.
2. We can reach it from the left: `(i-1, j)`.

That is all! We just evaluate `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`
**Complexity**: time comlexity is `O(mn)`, space complexity is `O(mn)`, which can be improved to `O(min(m,n))`.

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for i,j in product(range(1,m),range(1,n)):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]            
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

### 2. Math solution

Note, that we need to make overall `n + m - 2` steps, and exactly `m - 1` of them need to be right moves and `n - 1` down steps. By definition this is numbef of combinations to choose `n - 1` elements from `n + m - 2`.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(m+n)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        return factorial(m+n-2)//factorial(m-1)//factorial(n-1)
```
