#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-array/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-array/

#### Solution
In this problem we have `n = 1000`, which is too big to use dfs/backtracking, so we need to find some pattern. We need to avoid structures like `i < k < j` with `nums[i] + nums[j] = 2 * nums[k]`, which means that `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` has the same parity: they are both odd or even. This lead us to the following idea: let us split all numbers into `2` groups: all **odd** numbers and then all **even** numbers.

`[ odd numbers ] [ even numbers ]`

Then if `i, j, k` lies in two different groups, we are OK, we will hever have forbidden pattern. Also, if we look at odd numbers, imagine `n = 12`, then we have `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]` and if we subtract `1` to each number and divide each number by `2` then we have  `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Note, that is **linear** transform: when we did this transformation, if we did not have forbidden pattern, we still do not have it! So, what we need to do is to run function recursively for `odd` and `even` numbers and concatenate them.

#### Complexity
From the first sight, time complexity is `O(n log n)`, because we have recursion `C(n) = C(n//2) + C((n+1)//2)`, which lead to `O(n log n)`. However it can be shown that it is `O(n)`. Imagine case `n = 105`, then we have `105 -> (52, 53) -> (26, 26, 27, 27) -> (13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, 14)` and if we use memoisation, no need to solve problem each time for `13`, we can do it only once. On each level we will have at most **two** values in our recursion tree. Space complexity is `O(n)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def beautifulArray(self, N):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(N):
            if N == 1: return (1,)
            t1 = dfs((N+1)//2)
            t2 = dfs(N//2)
            return [i*2-1 for i in t1] + [i*2 for i in t2]
        
        return dfs(N)
