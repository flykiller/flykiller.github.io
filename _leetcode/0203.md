title: Leetcode 0203. Remove Linked List Elements
tags: []
---

Easy linked list traversal problem, without any smart ideas: just traverse list and do what is asked. Two small things which helps to simplify code:
1. When traverse, always look at the next element in list, because if we already at element with value equal to `val`, we can not delete it, we need to go back somehow.
2. Use dummy head to deal with case when head is equal to `val`.

So, basically our algorithm looks like this: we traverse our list and if value of next element is equal to `val`, we need to delete it, so we do `start.next = start.next.next`. Note, that in this case we do not move our pointers, because there can be more element equal to `val`. If value is not equal to `val`, we move to the next element.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` with only one pass, space complexity is `O(1)`, because we do not use any additional memory except couple of variable.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head, val):
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        start = dummy
        while start.next:
            if start.next.val == val:
                start.next = start.next.next
            else:
                start = start.next         
        return dummy.next   
```
