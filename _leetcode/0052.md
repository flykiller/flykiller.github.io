#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/

#### Solution
This problem is similar to problem **46** and **51**, basically we need to go over all `n!` permutations and then check if it is correct and write function to draw this solution. Let us use `dfs(board, c1, c2, c3)` function here, where:

1. `board` are positions of queen for the first, second and so on lines. Length of `board` is how many queens we already used.
2. `c1` is bit mask for columns, `c2` and `c3` for diagonals. Note, that we use `i-j+n` for one of the diagonals to avoid negative numbers.  Each time we try to take all possible positions and then check if we can put queen on this position.

#### Complexity
Time and space complexity is `O(n!)`.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def totalNQueens(self, n):
        def dfs(board, i, c1, c2, c3):
            if i == n: self.ans += 1
            
           for j in range(n):
                if c1 & 1<<j or c2 & 1<<i-j+n or c3 & 1<<i+j: continue
                dfs(board + [j], i + 1, c1 ^ 1<<j, c2 ^ 1<<i-j+n, c3 ^ 1<<i+j)
        
        self.ans = 0
        dfs([], 0, 0, 0, 0)
        return self.ans
