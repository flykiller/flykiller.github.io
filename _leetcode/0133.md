When you see the problem about graph, the first thing you need to think about is some classical graph traversal: dfs or bfs. Usually, there are `3` options with same complexities you can choose from:

1. Iterative dfs, that is dfs with stack
2. Recursive dfs, which is a bit simpler to code, but be careful if you have very deep graphs.
3. bfs - only iterative, there is no recursion version, because we use queue, not stack here.

Here I choose method number 2 (because it is easy to code of course)

Let us create global dictionary `mapping`, which will connect nodes from old graph with nodes from new graph and use recursive `dfs` function to construct these connections:
1. First, add connection `mapping[node] = Node(node.val)`
2. Traverse all neighbors of node and if node is not traversed, that is it is not in our `mapping`, then we run `dfs` for this neighbor. Also we add connection in new graph (we add it even if node is visited!)

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(E)`: this number of iterations we need for full dfs traversal. Space complexity is `O(E+V) = O(E)` for connected graph.

```python
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        def dfs(node):
            mapping[node] = Node(node.val)
            for neigh in node.neighbors:
                if neigh not in mapping: dfs(neigh)
                mapping[node].neighbors += [mapping[neigh]]
        
        if not node: return node
        mapping  = {}
        dfs(node)
        return mapping[node]
```
