title: Leetcode 1029. Two City Scheduling
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/1029/
---

Let us first send all the people to the first city. Now, we need to choose half of them and change their city from first to second. Which ones we need to choose? Obviously the half with the smallest **difference** of costs between second and first cities. This difference can be negative and positive. Let us go through example: `costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]`
Then:
1. We put all of them to 1 city and pay `10 + 30 + 400 + 30`
2. Now, evaluate differences: `10, 170, -350, -10`.
3. Choose 2 smallest differences, in this case it is `-350` and `-10` (they are negative, so we can say we get a refund)
4. Evaluate final sum as `10 + 30 + 400 + 30` + `-350 + -10 = 110`

**Complexity** is `O(n log n)`, because we need to make one sort, and `O(n)` for evaluating differences and two sums. Space complexity is `O(n)`, because we need to keep array of differences.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs):
        FirstCity = [i for i,j in costs]
        Diff = [j - i for i,j in costs]
        return sum(FirstCity) + sum(sorted(Diff)[:len(costs)//2])
```

It can be written as oneliner, but then it is quite difficult to follow.
