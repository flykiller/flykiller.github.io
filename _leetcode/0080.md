Let us use two pointers approach here: `slow` pointer and `fast` pointer, where slow will always be less or equal to fast. We are asked to remove duplicates only if we have more `2` of them, so we start with `slow` and `fast` equal to `2`.

Then we iterate through our data and check if `nums[slow - 2] == nums[fast]`: what does it mean? It means, that in fact `nums[slow-2] = ... = nums[fast]` and that we already have group of `3` or more equal elements: it this case we understand, that `slow` place should be rewritten with something else from future, so we do not move it. In other case, we have group of `2` or smaller, so we need to move `slow` pointer to right. In any case we move `fast` pointer one place to the right.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)`, we move our two pointers only in one direction. Space complexity is `O(1)`: we do it in-place as asked.

Note also, that this can be easily adjacted if you asked to have not `2` duplicates, but `k`: in this case we just need to change all 3 occurences of `2` to `k`.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
		if len(nums) < 2: return len(nums)
        slow, fast = 2, 2

        while fast < len(nums):
            if nums[slow - 2] != nums[fast]:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
        return slow
```
