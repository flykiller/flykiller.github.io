#### Problem statement

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/transform-to-chessboard/"> <font color = blue>https://leetcode.com/problems/transform-to-chessboard/

#### Solution
We can find some invariants of our board:

1. There will be `2` unique types of row and if `n` is odd, there should be `n/2` of each type; if `n` is even, there should be `(n+1)//2` and `(n-1)//2`.
2. The same is for columns.

It can be shown, that these two conditions are sufficient and enough. Then for the first row, if `n` is odd, we have one option: `10101...01` we need to transform to, if `n` is even, there are two options: `1010...10` and `0101...01` we need to check. The same is for columns.

Line `x1 = sum(i == j for i, j in zip(Cnt_r[0][0], patt1))` will check how many not equal elements we have between our pattern and one of our two types of columns, similar logic is for `patt2`. Then we have two options: try to make it `patt1` or `patt2`. Sometimes it is not possble to converge to one of them: in fact we can converge only if number of not equal elements is `even`, because on each step we can reduct number of not-equal elements by `2`. Imagine example `1000001111` which we try to make equal to `1010101010`. Then we enough to make only `2` steps to transform one to another!

#### Complexity
Final time complexity is `O(n^2)`, space is also `O(n^2)`, because I keep transposed grid and count rows and columns.

#### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def movesToChessboard(self, board):
        n = len(board)
        patt1 = ([0, 1]*(n//2+1))[:n]
        patt2 = ([1, 0]*(n//2+1))[:n]
        
        board_t = map(list, zip(*board))
        Cnt_r = list(Counter(tuple(row) for row in board).items())
        Cnt_c = list(Counter(tuple(row) for row in board_t).items())
        if len(Cnt_r) != 2 or len(Cnt_c) != 2: return -1
        if abs(Cnt_r[0][1] - Cnt_r[1][1]) > 1: return -1
        if abs(Cnt_c[0][1] - Cnt_c[1][1]) > 1: return -1
        
        x1 = sum(i != j for i,j in zip(Cnt_r[0][0], patt1))
        y1 = sum(i != j for i,j in zip(Cnt_c[0][0], patt1))
        
        x2 = sum(i != j for i,j in zip(Cnt_r[0][0], patt2))
        y2 = sum(i != j for i,j in zip(Cnt_c[0][0], patt2))
        
        cands_x = [x for x in [x1, x2] if x % 2 == 0]
        cands_y = [y for y in [y1, y2] if y % 2 == 0]
        
        return min(cands_x)//2 + min(cands_y)//2
```

#### Remark
We can also notice, that all feasible boards will have the following property:
1. If `n` is even, first column and row should have `n//2` ones, if `n` is odd, both of them should have `(n+1)//2` or `(n-1)//2` ones.
2. For each rectangle with sides parallel to grid, it has even number of zeroes: it means that all elements uniquely defined by first column and first row.
