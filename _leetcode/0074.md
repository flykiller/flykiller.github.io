title: Leetcode 0074. Search a 2D Matrix
permalink: /Leetcode Problems/0074/
---

What we have in this problem is matrix, which is sorted and what we use to find element in sorted structure? Correct, this is binary search. Imagine, that we have matrix

`10  11 12 13`
`14 15 16 17`
`18 19 20 21`

Let us flatten this matrix, so now we have `10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21` and do binary search in this list. However if you do it, we will have `O(mn)` complexity, so we will use **virtual** flatten: we do not do it for all matrix, but only for elements we need:  if we need element number `i` from our flattened list, it coresponds to element `matrix[i//m][i%m]` in our matrix.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(log mn)`, space complexity is `O(1)`.


```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return False
        m, n = len(matrix[0]), len(matrix)
        beg, end = 0, m*n - 1
        while beg < end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if matrix[mid//m][mid%m] < target:
                beg = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
        return matrix[beg//m][beg%m] == target
```
