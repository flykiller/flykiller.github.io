title: Leetcode 1291. Sequential Digits
tags: []
---

Let us create queue, where we put numbers `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9` at the beginning. Then on each step we are going to extract number and put this number with added to the end incremented last digit: so we have on the next step:

`2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12`
`3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,23`
...
`12,23,34,45,56,67,78,89`
`23,34,45,56,67,78,89,123`,
...

On each, when we extract number from the beginning we check if it is in our range and if it is, we put it into our `out` list. Then we add new candidate to the end of our queue. In this way we make sure, that we generate elements in increasing order.

**Complexity**:  There will be `9+8+...+ 1` numbers with sqeuential digits at all and for each of them we need to check it at most once (though in practice we wil finish earlier), so time complexity is `O(45) = O(1)`. Space complexity is also `O(45) = O(1)`.

```python
class Solution:
    def sequentialDigits(self, low, high):
        out = []
        queue = deque(range(1,10))
        while queue:
            elem = queue.popleft()
            if low <= elem <= high:
                out.append(elem)
            last = elem % 10
            if last < 9: queue.append(elem*10 + last + 1)
                    
        return out
```
