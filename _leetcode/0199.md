title: Leetcode 0199. Binary Tree Right Side View
tags: []
---

Like in many other problems about binary trees, we need to somehow traverse our tree, using dfs (inorder, preorder or postorder) or bfs. There are different solutions here, I use almost **inorder** traversal, with just one small change: instead of going `Left -> Node -> Right`, we will go `Right -> Node -> Left`. In this way we first visit nodes on the right side of our tree. Algorithm will look like this:

1. Create `ans` dictionary, which for each level `H` will keep the rightest node.
2. Traverse tree: first visit right children and if we do not have this `H` in `ans` yet, we put it there, then visit left children. Note again that with this order of traversal we always will put the rightest node for each level and next time we visit this level we will do nothing.
3. Finally, create list from our dictionary.

**Complexity**: time complexity is `O(n)` for classical dfs, space is `O(h)`, again classical complexity for dfs as well as this amount of space we need to keep in our answer.

```python
class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root):
        ans = {}
        def dfs(node, H):
            if not node: return 
            
            dfs(node.right, H + 1)
            if H not in ans: ans[H] = node.val
            dfs(node.left, H + 1)
            
        dfs(root, 0)
        return [ans[i] for i in range(len(ans))]
```
