This problem is called Dutch national flag problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem

The idea here is the following: we keep 3 pointers: for each of colors (numbers). I called them
`beg = 0`, `mid = 0`, `end =  len(nums) - 1`. The **idea** here is to put sorted `0` and `1` to the **beginning** and sorted `2`s to the **end**.  Then we iterate over all elements and process each new element in the following way. Imagine, that we already sorted some of the elements, our invariant will be `00...0011...11......22....22`, where we already put some `0` and `1` in the beggining and some `2` to the end. Then there are 3 possible optinos for new element `?`:

1. `00...0011...11?......22....22`, where `? = 1`, then we do not need to change any elements, just move `mid` pointer by `1` to the right.
2. `00...0011...11?......22....22`, where `? = 2`, then we need to put this element befor the first already sorted `2`, so we change these elements and then move pointer `end` by `1` to the left.
3. `00...0011...11?......22....22`, where `? = 0`, then we need to swap this element with the last  sorted `0` and also move two pointers `mid` and `beg` by 1.

We can see it this way, that pointers `beg`, `mid` and `end` always point at elements just `after` the last `0`, `after` the last `1` and `before` the first `2`.

**Complexity**: Time complexity is `O(n)`, because each moment of time we move at least one of the pointers. Additional space complexity is `O(1)`: to keep only 3 variables: `beg`, `mid` and `end`.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        beg, mid, end = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while mid <= end:
            if nums[mid] == 0:
                nums[beg], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[beg]
                mid += 1
                beg += 1
            elif nums[mid] == 2:
                nums[mid], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[mid]
                end -= 1
            else:  #nums[mid] == 1:
                mid += 1
```
